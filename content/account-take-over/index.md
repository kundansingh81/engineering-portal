**What is Account Takeover?**

**_Account takeover fraud,_** or an ATO attack, happens when a fraudster logs into someone else’s account. The practice, which is a form of identity theft, is also known as credential stuffing, and costs organizations millions of dollars each year.

**How to identify possible Account Takeover?**



*   **An unexpectedly high number of login attempts:** High number of login attempts for the user could be an indication for Account Take Over where the fraudster is trying to do password stuffing and try to login into other user accounts.
*   **Unexpected no for reset password request:** Unexpected no of reset password request could be another sign of Account Take Over. Usually, users are not able to reset passwords they will prefer support instead of doing multiple reset of password.
*   **Frequent change in device and location for the transaction:** Frequent Change in the device, IP, Location could be an indication of Account Take Over. Normally user doesn’t change there device and Location verify frequently.
*   **Suspicious IP addresses:** Login request coming for suspicious IP or multiple users sharing the same IP’s or Device could be an indication of Account take over.
*   **Change in user behavior:** Change in user behavior like doing frequent transactions or having multiple updates in the profile could be an indication of Account Take Over.

**Mean to perform Account Takeover?**



*   **Hacking:** The most popular hacking technique for Account Take Over is brute force attack, where the attacker uses automated scripts and try to login with multiple password combination, hoping to generate a successful password.
*   **Phishing & Spear Phishing:** The attacker will use email correspondence to trick users into revealing their personal information. While phishing emails can be automated and easier to spot, spear phishing emails are highly targeted and much more deceptive.
*   **Social Engineering:** Account takeover perpetrators will spend time researching across open databases and social media, looking for pertinent information like name, location, phone number, or names of family members – anything that will assist in guessing a password.

*   **Analyzing user behavior:** Analysing user behavior like location device or biometric behavior could help to prevent Account Takeover.
